## What's Included
When you download the zip file, you will get a few things. 

1. [**Lovely Dashboard**](#dashboard) - A custom designed dashboard to use on your phone or dedicated DDU screen
2. [**Lovely Overlay**](#stream-overlay) - If you're a streamer, you can use this overlay in OBS or any other broadcasting software
3. **LED Profile** - A 16x LED profile for your DDU

## Download & Install
This is a SimHub Dashboard, therefore **SimHub Dash** app is required to run it (Doh!). Also, since the UI was a considerate design, you will also need to download and install the **Roboto Font Family** from Google (free).

Finally, download the [**Latest Release**](https://github.com/cdemetriadis/lovely-dashboard/releases). PS: I've also included a 16 LED profile should you need one.

1. [SimHub Dash](https://www.simhubdash.com) app
2. [Roboto Font Family](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto) by Christian Robertson
3. [**Download latest release**](https://github.com/cdemetriadis/lovely-dashboard/releases)
4. **Double-click** on the `.simhubdash` files (Dashboard & Overlay) to install in SimHub

## Compatibility

### Screen Size

* 16:9 screen ratio
