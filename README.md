A multifunctional feature packed SimHub dashboard (DDU), specifically for Sim Racing.

## Game Compatibility

* Assetto Corsa Competizione
	* All vehicles are supported

## Requirements
This is a SimHub Dashboard, therefore **SimHub Dash** app is required to run it (Doh!). Also, since the UI was a considerate design, you will also need to download and install the **Roboto Font Family** from Google.
