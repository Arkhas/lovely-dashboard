> ### If you like this dashboard, please consider subscribing to my Youtube channel [Lovely Sim Racing](http://j76.me/LSR), where I stream as often as I can. You'll even see this Dashboard in action too.

## Download & Install
You can download this dashboard from **GitHub** or **Race Department**. Make sure you've got the fonts installed, otherwise the dashboard will look like crap sitting in front of your eyes. When the fonts are installed, just **double click on the dashboard file**. I've also included a 16 LED profile should you need one.

* [Download from GitHub]()

## Compatibility
This is an ongoing project, so I will add more Screen Sizes and Sims as time progresses, but these are the ones I use so it's where I started.

### Screen Size
* 5" 850x480

### Sims
* Assetto Corsa Competizione

ðŸ§¬ [Detialed Compatibility List](compatibility.md)

## Requirements
This is a SimHub Dashboard, therefore **SimHub Dash** app is required to run it (Doh!). Also, since the UI was a considerate design, you will also need to download and install the **Roboto Font Family** from Google.
