## What's Included
When you download the zip file, you will get a few things. 

1. [**Lovely Dashboard**](#the-lovely-dashboard) - A custom designed dashboard to use on your phone or dedicated DDU screen
2. **Lovely Overlay** - If you're a streamer, you can use this overlay in OBS or any other broadcasting software
3. **LED Profile** - A 16x & 18x LED profile for your DDU

## Download & Install
This is a SimHub Dashboard, therefore **SimHub Dash** app is required to run it (Doh!). Also, since the UI was a considerate design, you will also need to download and install the **Roboto Font Family** from Google (free).

1. Download & Install [SimHub Dash v8.0+](https://www.simhubdash.com) app
2. Download & Install [Roboto Font Family](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto) by Christian Robertson
3. Download & Install the [**Lovely Dashboard Latest Release**](https://github.com/cdemetriadis/lovely-dashboard/releases)

#### For iRacing
If you want to use the Lovely Dashboard with iRacing, you will also need to install a library by Romainrob.

1. Download & Install Romainrob's [iRacing Extra Properties DLL](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1AiIWHviD4j-_D-zgRrjJU1AFhJ_xmass)

:warning: **Warning: Simhub Dash v8.0+** is required to run the Lovely Dashboard 1.5.0+
 
## Settings (NEW)
As of version 1.5.4, the Lovely Dashboard can also be setup to your liking. You will need to copy the file `Lovely-Dashboard_settings.json` into `./SimHub/JavascriptExtensions`. 

![Copy the settings file into the JavascriptExtensions folder](docs/images/settings-file.png)

To change your personal settings, you will need to edit the file `Lovely-Dashboard_settings.json` in any text editor. The available settings are:

#### `driverName`
You can change the way the Driver Name is formatted and displayed.

- `0` (Default) - Will display names as "**F. Lastname**"
- `1` Will display names as "**Firstname L.**"

#### `lapReview`
Choose when the Lap Review Alert should appear.

- `0` **Never** show the Lap Review Alert
- `1` (Default) - **Qualifying** & **Practice** - This will only show the Lap Review Alert during **Qualifying** & **Practice** sessions
- `2` **Always** - Will show the Lap Review Alert on every lap

#### `lapReviewDelay`
Set how much time in milliseconds to display the Lap Review Alert. (eg. 1000 = 1 second)

- `5000` (Default) - Display the Lap Review Alert for 5 seconds

**:information_source: If you do not copy the settings file, the default values will be used.**
  
## Compatibility
This is an ongoing project, so I will add more Screen Sizes and Sims as time progresses, but these are the ones I use so it's where I started.

### Screen Size
* Native 5" 850x480 (VoCore)
* Any 16:9 screen ratio is ideal, but...
* Any device compatible with SimHub is fine

### Compatible Sims
* [Assetto Corsa Competizione](#assetto-corsa-competizione)
* [iRacing](#iracing-new)


## The Lovely Dashboard
If you were wondering why this is the best SimHub dashboard out there, wonder no more. It's good looking and feature packed but with considerate design and proper information architecture.
