## What's Included
When you download the zip file, you will get a few things. 

1. [**Lovely Dashboard**](#the-lovely-dashboard) - A custom designed dashboard to use on your phone or dedicated DDU screen
2. **Lovely Overlay** - If you're a streamer, you can use this overlay in OBS or any other broadcasting software
3. **LED Profile** - A 16x & 18x LED profile for your DDU

## Download & Install
This is a SimHub Dashboard, therefore **SimHub Dash** app is required to run it (Doh!). Also, since the UI was a considerate design, you will also need to download and install the **Roboto Font Family** from Google (free).

Finally, download the [**Latest Release**](https://github.com/cdemetriadis/lovely-dashboard/releases). 

1. [SimHub Dash v8.0+](https://www.simhubdash.com) app
2. [Roboto Font Family](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto) by Christian Robertson
3. *[Optional for iRacing]* Romainrob's [iRacing Extra Propeties DLL](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1AiIWHviD4j-_D-zgRrjJU1AFhJ_xmass) - I only use this for the SoF display
4. [**Download latest release**](https://github.com/cdemetriadis/lovely-dashboard/releases)
5. **Double-click** on the `.simhubdash` files (Dashboard & Overlay) to install in SimHub

:warning: **Warning: Simhub Dash v8.0+** is required to run the Lovely Dashboard 1.5.0+
 
## Compatibility
This is an ongoing project, so I will add more Screen Sizes and Sims as time progresses, but these are the ones I use so it's where I started.

### Screen Size
* Native 5" 850x480 (VoCore)
* Any 16:9 screen ratio is ideal, but...
* Any device compatible with SimHub is fine

### Compatible Sims
* [Assetto Corsa Competizione](#assetto-corsa-competizione)
* [iRacing](#iracing-new) **(NEW)**


# The Lovely Dashboard
If you were wondering why this is the best SimHub dashboard out there, wonder no more. It's good looking and feature packed but with considerate design and proper information architecture.
