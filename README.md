## Download & Install
This is a SimHub Dashboard, therefore **SimHub Dash** app is required to run it (Doh!). Also, since the UI was a considerate design, you will also need to download and install the **Roboto Font Family** from Google (free).

Finally, download the [**Latest Release**](https://github.com/cdemetriadis/lovely-dashboard/releases). PS: I've also included a 16 LED profile should you need one.
