A multifunctional feature packed SimHub dashboard (DDU), specifically for Sim Racing.

> ### If you like this dashboard, please consider subscribing to my Youtube channel [Lovely Sim Racing](http://j76.me/LSR), where I stream as often as I can. You'll even see this Dashboard in action too.

## Download & Install
You can download this dashboard from **GitHub** or **Race Department**. Make sure you've got the fonts installed, otherwise the dashboard will look like crap sitting in front of your eyes. When the fonts are ready, just double click on the dashboard file. If you've used SimHub before, it should work out of the box with ACC.

## Game Compatibility

* Assetto Corsa Competizione

## Requirements
This is a SimHub Dashboard, therefore **SimHub Dash** app is required to run it (Doh!). Also, since the UI was a considerate design, you will also need to download and install the **Roboto Font Family** from Google.
