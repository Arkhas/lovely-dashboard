# Available Actions

Actions in SimHub are ways to change "pages" on certain parts of the screen. This way, everyone can quickly glance at various information on the same screen.

In Simhub, you will need to assign the actions to buttons on your Wheel, Button Box or even Stream Deck. You can choose whatever makes sense for your personal needs.

Here's a really short thread on [setting the Action Buttons in SimHub](https://www.simhubdash.com/community-2/postid/1392/)
